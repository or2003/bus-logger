# bus-logger
The goal of this app is to record the IMU data from my phone in order to analyse my bus rides and generate simulation of what it's like riding a bus.
The project has 2 parts:
1. the app that records my rides and saves each ride to a csv file.
2. a post proccessing script that analyses each csv file.
